				My overarching research interest is affective neuroscience. Over the course of my PhD, I have been involved in various projects that address 
				diagnosis and treatment of adolescent and adult depression. Specifically, I worked with children's multimodal data to validate depression measurements 
				and gather insights in topics such as informant discrepancy (parent-child disagreement on whether the child is depressed) <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/z956k">(preprint)</a>. 
				I've also contributed to collecting and analyzing multi-echo MRI data with the goal of improving targeting of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for treatement-resistant depression <a href="https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004787/">(pilot dataset)</a>.
				I am also interested in neuropsychoendocrinology, specifically in the effect of oxytocin on human brain <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab404/6494709">(paper)</a> and its role in various psychiatric disorders, and also in and the role of dopamine and serotonin in affective disorders.

				Before joining NIMH, I spent a few years doing social neuroscience research
				at Diana Prata's Lab. In particular, I looked at the effect of oxytocin on human
				resting-state EEG  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab404/6494709">(2022 paper in Cerebral Cortex)</a>. <br>
			
				Before that, I obtained an MSc in Neurobiology from the University of Porto and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh,
				where I analysed human eye-tracking data. From my studies at the University of Edinburgh, I have a background in Natural Language Processing.

				I work with large datasets and apply a variety of computational tools to analyze them. As far as programming languages go, I'm most comfortable with Python, but I've also been exposed to R and Matlab. <br>
				For statistical analysis, I've used SPSS, but I prefer R or R wrappers in Python.<br>

				I live with bipolar disorder type 1, and I am an active participant of the NIH's DEIA activities.

				Outside of research, I enjoy spending time in nature (hiking, backpacking, camping) and board games. I am also a theatre lover and a travel enthusiast.
