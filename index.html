<p style="color:#3A3A3A"> I am a PhD student of Drs Argyris Stringaris (NIMH, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/mbdu/index.shtml">Section of Clinical and Computational Psychiatry: CompΨ</a> and Diana Prata (University of Lisbon, IBEB, <a href="https://dpratalab.wordpress.com/">Biomedical Neuroscience Lab: DPrataLab</a>).
I use machine learning in research on human affective neuroscience.</p>

<p style="color:#3A3A3A"> Before this, I obtained an MSc in Neurobiology from the University of Porto and, at DPrataLab, researched on the effect of oxytocin on human resting-state EEG. Before that, I obtained an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and analysed human eye-tracking data.
My current research mainly focuses on human affective neuroscience. I am also interested in, and contributing to, a range of topics in social neuroscience and psychopathology. Outside of research, I enjoy cooking and eating my way through the world’s map (can’t ever say no to Goan fish curry!), spending time in nature and winter sports. I am also an eager, albeit not very proficient, runner and climber.
