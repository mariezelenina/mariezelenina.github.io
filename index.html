## Marie Zelenina

I am a PhD student of Drs Argyris Stringaris (NIMH, [Section of Clinical and Computational Psychiatry: CompΨ](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/mbdu/index.shtml)) and Diana Prata (University of Lisbon, IBEB, [DPrataLab](https://dpratalab.wordpress.com/)).
I use machine learning in research on human affective neuroscience.

Prior to joining the lab, I obtained an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, UK and an MSc in Neurobiology from the University of Porto, Portugal, and did research in human social neuroscience, focusing on the effect of oxytocin on resting-state EEG networks. Outside of research, I enjoy cooking and eating my way through the world’s map, spending time in nature and winter sports. I am also an eager, albeit not very proficient, runner and climber.
